# SimplePasswordValidation

A password	must	have	at	least	eight	characters.
• A	password	consists	of	only 	letters	and	digits.
• A	password	must	contain	at	least	two	digits.

Write	a	program	 that	prompts	the	user	to	enter	a	password	and	displays	"valid	password"	
if	the	rule	is	followed
	or	"invalid	password"	otherwise.


No space 

And no special character

Letters and digits only
